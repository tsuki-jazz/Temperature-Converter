### Temperature Converter

**Description**

This C project is a temperature converter from that has an option of Fahrenheit to Celsius and Celsius to Fahrenheit. It is a simple tool for converting between those temperatures. 
To use this program, you need to select which conversion you would like to use. The current options are  'Fahrenheit to Celsius' or 'Celsius to Fahrenheit'. Then, you need to input the value in Fahrenheit or Celsius. Afterwards, the program will send back your converted value.
I had this in mind because it is often that I have to look online to find the answer and I am sure many others have used it at some point too.
